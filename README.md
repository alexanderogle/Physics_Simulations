# Physics_Simulations

Reports on Matlab computational physics projects can be found under the directory
/reports.

All project code can be found in the report pdf, at the very end. 
This is the code used in the individual report.  

All pdfs were generated using LaTeX. There are undoubtedly some terrible errors with text symbols because of this (poor Schroedinger). 
Simulations and images made in Matlab.
